        <h2>Where did I begin my coding journey?</h2>
        <p class="blurb">I started actually coding years ago hear and there.
            Then I fell out of it and just kind of let life happen and really
            fell off on coding anything at all. Then my best friend got into coding
            and it sparked my intrest again over time. I then started learning C#
            using multiple books from all over. I felt like there was stuff that
            I could come up with but I couldn't really think of projects to do that
            were on my level (beginner). So, I joined a few coding websites and other
            resources that helped me along the way.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a></h2>
        <p class="blurb">Udemy is by far my favorite place to learn and find
            information and videos on languages that I want to learn. They are always
            having these flash sells were videos that are normally $100+ are between $10
            and $15. So, that is one place that I definitely recommend checking out!</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.Freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a></h2>
        <p class="blurb">Free Code Camp is what really got me into web design. I had dabbled with
            webdevelopment before but that was years and years ago and when I was playing
            around with it thats when flash was the biggest and baddest thing to hit the web.
            Some of you younger kids may not know what flash is or how important and big to
            the web it was. Anyways, Free Code Camp is great it teaches you alot about
            web deisgn javascript and much more. LinkedIn even credits it to education and job.
            While some may not agree free code camp is a bootcamp for web development. With a
            big community to help you out when you need it. So, I definitely recommend you looking
            into that if you want to get your feet wet and see if web development is for you!</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.Generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">General Assembly</a></h2>
        <p class="blurb">Last and definitely not least was general assembly. Once I
            knew that I really wanted to look into web development as my career I looked into
            fast tracking my education in the field and started landing on these places called "bootcamps".
            They are 12 - 16 week courses usually and are direct job replacements.
            I was immersed in the world of web coding for 12 weeks from 9am to 6pm or later
            Monday thru Friday and weekends as well if it was project week. I don't recommend them to
            everyone because the work load is heavy and the pace of class is <strong>SUPER</strong> fast paced.
            But if you can get through it and you can really dedicate your time into practicing, practicing, and
            more practicing then it might be the place for you.(Can I get a +1 for the oxford comma?)</p>
