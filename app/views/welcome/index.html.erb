    <hr>
    <P>I am a Full Stack Web Developer living in Atlanta, Georgia. I have recently completed the Web Development Immersive
      @ General Assembly.</P>

    <p>While at General Assembly, I learned a lot about Javascript, HTML, and CSS3. I also have experience with complete
      MEAN stack with Angular 1, along with Ruby, and Ruby on Rails with Postgres Database.</p>

    <p>I am constantly working on honing my skills and increasing my programming knowledge for hours everyday. I strive
    to be the best developer that I can be and love to learn more! Feel free to follow me on my GitHub account, I am
      constantly sharing code there or follow my Instagram and Facebook to see what crazy things I post throughout the day.</p>
